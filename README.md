# Library Management System

This is a library management system project for the CS112 - Programming Fundamentals course. The system is designed to manage a book library and provide functionality for customers to borrow and return books.

## Project Description

The project involves the implementation of a library management system using object-oriented programming principles. The system consists of several classes, including `Library`, `Book`, `User`, `Customer`, and `Admin`. Each class has specific attributes and operations to fulfill the requirements of the system.

The main features of the library management system include:

- Creating and managing users (customers and admins)
- Adding and removing books from the library
- Allowing customers to borrow and return books
- Searching and displaying books by author, category, and title
- Tracking borrowed and non-borrowed books

The project also includes a bonus requirement to save data to files (`admins.txt` and `books.txt`) and load the data at the start of the program.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
```

2. Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler:

```
g++ main.cpp Library.cpp Book.cpp User.cpp Customer.cpp Admin.cpp -o library
./library
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the library management system.

## Files and Directory Structure

- `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the program.
- `Library.h` and `Library.cpp`: Implementation of the `Library` class.
- `Book.h` and `Book.cpp`: Implementation of the `Book` class.
- `User.h` and `User.cpp`: Implementation of the `User` class.
- `Customer.h` and `Customer.cpp`: Implementation of the `Customer` class.
- `Admin.h` and `Admin.cpp`: Implementation of the `Admin` class.
- `admins.txt`: File to store the admin credentials.
- `books.txt`: File to store the library books.
